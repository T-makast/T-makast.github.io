					<h3>Varicella is highly contagious</h3>
					<p>You can get chickenpox just by being in the same room as someone who has it.
The disease is spread by respiratory droplets. This means you’re more likely to get chickenpox from someone who is coughing or sneezing, but it’s possible that even talking could spread the disease.</p>

					<h3>Complications during pregnancy</h3>
					<p>Low birth weight and limb abnormalities are more common among babies born to women who are infected with chickenpox early in their pregnancy. When a mother is infected with chickenpox in the week before birth or within a couple of days after giving birth, her baby has a higher risk of developing a serious, life-threatening infection.</p>

					<h3>Shingles</h3>
					<p>Once you have had chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection and become immune to catching it again. However, the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, remains inactive (dormant) in your body's nerve tissues and can return later in life as an illness called shingles. The main symptom of shingles is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy blisters</p>

					<h3>Dangerous for adults</h3>
					<p>Some complications are more commonly seen in immunocompromised and adult patients with chickenpox including bacterial infection (usually affects skin and soft tissues), pneumonia (lung infection), brain infection or inflammation (encephalitis), liver inflammation and bleeding problems</p>
